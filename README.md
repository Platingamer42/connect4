# connect4

simple connect four game built with python and pygame.
Used an object-oriented approach for no apparent reason. Maybe I just like wasting my time

for most of the game I used this (^1)  as a reference. For the #checkWin-Function i took advise from our friends over at StackOverflow since the one used in ^1 seemed
too slow.

ToDos: 
- Add the fucking AI
- Add a menu of some sort
